# codestrips-app

Let’s build an API for Codestrips! Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips. You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to save these to a SQLite database and retrieve them so that they persist even when you restart your server.
